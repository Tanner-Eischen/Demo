GameDevBoard is a collaborative 2D level editor for game teams.
It lets you design tile-based maps, place and configure sprites, and build playable board layouts with real-time multiplayer editing.
Feature explanation
Real-time collaboration: Multiple users can edit the same board at once with live sync and presence indicators.
Advanced tile editing: Supports brush-based painting, terrain/props layers, auto-tiling, and multiple tileset types (single, variant, multi-tile, and autotile).
Sprite workflow: Add sprites with animation states (idle/walk/run/etc.), position them on the map, and manage sprite behavior visually.

AI-assisted creation: Built-in AI chat can generate terrain patterns, paths/rivers, platformer layouts, and assist with rapid level prototyping from natural language prompts.
Project + board management: Organize work into projects with multiple boards, save/load/export data, and iterate quickly across map types.
